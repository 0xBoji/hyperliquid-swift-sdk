## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Configuration Setup

Copy the example configuration file and add your credentials:

cp config.json.example config.json
```

Edit `config.json` with your wallet details:

```json
{
  "private_key": "0x...",
  "testnet": true,
  "wallet_address": "0x..."
}
```

### 2. Running Examples

Each example can be run independently. Here are some common patterns:

#### Basic Trading
```swift
// Run basic usage example
swift run BasicUsage

// Run trading example
swift run TradingExample
```

#### Advanced Features
```swift
// Market making strategy
swift run MarketMakingExample

// Spot trading operations
swift run SpotTradingExample

// WebSocket real-time data
swift run WebSocketExample

// Staking operations
swift run StakingExample

// Convert to multi-sig user (PERMANENT - use with caution!)
swift run ConvertToMultiSigExample

// Configure big blocks
swift run UseBigBlocksExample

// Setup builder fees
swift run BuilderFeeExample
```

## üìã Example Descriptions

### MarketMakingExample.swift
Demonstrates a market making strategy similar to Python SDK's `basic_adding.py`. This example shows how to provide liquidity by placing both buy and sell orders around the current market price.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time market data monitoring
- Automated order placement and cancellation
- Position-based order management
- Risk management with position limits

### SpotTradingExample.swift
Shows how to perform spot trading operations, similar to Python SDK's `basic_spot_order.py`.

**Key Features:**
- Spot user state queries
- Spot order placement (buy/sell)
- Order status tracking
- Balance management

### WebSocketExample.swift
Demonstrates real-time data streaming using WebSocket subscriptions, similar to Python SDK's `basic_ws.py`.

**Key Features:**
- All market prices (allMids)
- Order book updates (l2Book)
- Trade updates (trades)
- User events and fills
- Candle data streaming
- BBO (Best Bid/Offer) updates

### StakingExample.swift
Shows staking operations and token delegation, similar to Python SDK's `basic_staking.py`.

**Key Features:**
- User staking summary
- Staking delegations
- Staking rewards history
- Token delegation to validators
- Undelegation operations

### ConvertToMultiSigExample.swift
Demonstrates how to convert a regular account to a multi-signature user account. This is a **permanent operation** that requires multiple signatures for future transactions.

**Key Features:**
- Account conversion to multi-sig
- Authorized user management
- Threshold configuration

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** This is irreversible. Only use on testnet unless you fully understand the implications.

### UseBigBlocksExample.swift
Shows how to enable/disable big blocks for improved performance in high-frequency trading scenarios.

**Key Features:**
- Enable big blocks for better throughput
- Disable big blocks when not needed
- Performance optimization

### BuilderFeeExample.swift
Demonstrates how to approve builder fees and route orders through specific builders for potentially better execution.

**Key Features:**
- Builder fee approval
- Order routing through builders
- Fee rate configuration

### MultiSigOrderExample.swift
Shows how to execute orders using multi-signature authentication, requiring multiple authorized signatures.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-signature order execution
- Signature collection and validation
- Threshold-based authorization

**Note:** This example uses placeholder signatures. In production, you need real signatures from authorized wallets.

## üîß Development Tips

### Error Handling
All examples include comprehensive error handling:

```swift
do {
    let result = try await client.someOperation()
    print("‚úÖ Success: \(result)")
} catch {
    print("‚ùå Error: \(error)")
}
```

### Testnet vs Mainnet
Always test on testnet first:

```swift
let client = try await ExampleUtils.setupClient(config: config, useTestnet: true)
```

### Configuration Management
Use the shared `ExampleUtils` for consistent setup:

```swift
let config = try ExampleUtils.loadConfig()
let client = try await ExampleUtils.setupClient(config: config, useTestnet: true)
```

## üß™ Testing

The examples are designed to work with the test suite. Run tests to verify functionality:

```bash
swift test
```

## üìö Related Documentation

- **Main README**: `../README.md` - SDK overview and installation
- **Feature Comparison**: `../FEATURE_COMPARISON.md` - Python vs Swift feature parity
- **API Documentation**: Generated docs for detailed API reference

## ü§ù Contributing

When adding new examples:

1. Follow the existing naming convention
2. Include comprehensive error handling
3. Add detailed comments explaining the functionality
4. Update this README with the new example
5. Ensure the example works on testnet

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Always test on testnet first** before using real funds
- **Multi-sig conversion is permanent** - cannot be easily reversed
- **Builder fees** require main wallet permissions, not agent wallets
- **Keep your private keys secure** and never commit them to version control
- **Market making strategies** require careful risk management and monitoring
- **WebSocket examples** demonstrate subscription patterns but may need full implementation
- **Spot trading** requires proper spot token balances and permissions

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues with the examples:

1. Check the main SDK documentation
2. Verify your configuration is correct
3. Ensure you're using testnet for testing
4. Review the error messages for specific guidance
