// MARK: - Usage Instructions
/*
 To run this example:
 
 1. Ensure you have a valid config.json file with your wallet configuration
 2. Make sure your account has sufficient permissions (main wallet, not agent)
 3. Ensure you have sufficient balance for the test order
 4. Run the example:
    ```
    swift run BuilderFeeExample
    ```
 
 Builder fees allow you to route orders through specific builders who may provide
 better execution or additional services in exchange for a small fee.
